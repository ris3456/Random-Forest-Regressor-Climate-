# Random-Forest-Regressor-Climate-
ML model for predicting Outgoing longwave radiation using co2 and temperature
Satellite data to measure following and use of ML to explore relation
with atmospheric CO2 and climate change of Outgoing Longer Radiation

Objectives

● Understanding different satellite data and GIS tools.
● Relating above variable with CO2 and climate change and temperature.
● Using satellite data and ML to model and predict these variables and possible impact
on CO2 levels and climate.
